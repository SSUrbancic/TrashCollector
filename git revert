    Edit method for customer was deleting the user ID from the customer table. Fixed this by adding userID to the bind of the Post edit method. also added a hiddenfor in the Edit view of the customer model. Recurring pick up day wasn't being created for similar reasons. Didn't have it binded for create or edit methods so I added it to those locations.

    Updated the CustomerPickUps viewResult in the TrashPickUpsController. Updated the method to look for pickups where the customerID of the current user matches the Customer ID in the TrashPickUps table rather than where the zipcodes match since there could be multiple customers in one zip code.

    Recreated migrations as well as trashpickup controller. Added a foreign key to cutomer and and trashpickup tables. Changed customer index to display a link to creating new trashpickup instead a list of all of the customers. Wasn't able to create a new pick up since the customerID wasn't being populated. Used a linq statement to set variable customerID equal to the customerID of the user creating the pick up. Haven't been able to test functionality yet, need to find a way to access the index page of customer upon logging in so that customers can manipulate the website without seeing everything an employee would as well.
